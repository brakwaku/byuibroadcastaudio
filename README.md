# ASKAS Time tracking application

## About

A web application that is used by a supervisor and his subordinates to keep track of the hours worked and the tasks they worked on. This application was developed because the supervisor had to create an excel document every week and provide a link for the subordinates to enter their hours worked and what they worked on.

The application was created with technologies such as NodeJS / ExpressJS, MongoDB, JavaScript, Jquery, Ajax, HTML / EJS, Custom CSS, Boostrap, and some other external libraries and packages.

It follows the MVC pattern and includes route protection, user authentication, password encryption, form validation, error handling, protection against CSRF attacks and performs CRUD operations.
